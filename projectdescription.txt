The following animation demonstrates a Jupyter Notebooks ipynb file that allows the user to input an address of their choosing to be utilized within the OSMnx library. An OSM and Folium plot of the area is produced. Next, the user chooses a street node (the squares on the plots) for both the origin and destination. An OSM and Folium plot is then returned with the street path of shortest distance between the two nodes. Likewise, plots for the shortest one-way street path and a comparison between the path with shortest distance and shortest travel-time is also produced from the OSM data. Lastly, a random walk generation that begins from the origin and is of 70 steps will be produced.
